# Completed Stuff 
- Added Classes for Directed and Undirected Graphs along with their weighted counterparts
- Added a BFS and DFS algorithm
- Added Dijkstra's and Kruskal's algorithms
- Added APSP and Network Flow algorithms 

- Implemented a project to find a perfect matching of minimum weight in a bipartite graph using the Hungarian Algorithm  

# To Do  

- Fix the compilation errors in undirected weighted graph
