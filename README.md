# FAST-G
This library contains implementations of various Graph Optimization and Search algorithms in C++. This project is under the Seasons of Code Initiative by the Web n Coding Club, IIT Bombay.

# How to use these files 
The steps to use these files are as follows :  
g++ Graphs.hpp  
g++ -I . Graphs.cpp  (Note that it is a capital i)  
./a.out  
  
For the project :  
g++ Project.hpp  
g++ -I . Project.cpp  
./a.out  

# Issues (hopefully to-be rectified soon)
Right now, the Graphs code is having compilation issues relating to the use of deleted constructors
