# FAST-G
This library contains implementations of various Graph Optimization and Search algorithms in C++. This project is under the Seasons of Code Initiative by the Web n Coding Club, IIT Bombay.

# STUFF THAT IS COMPLETED
Created a graph base class and implemented BFS and DFS on it

# TO DO 
To implement MST algorithms, Djikastra's etc.

# COMMENTS
I personally don't like the fact that my 'nodes' object in the graph base class is a vector that consists of pointers to all the nodes. 
So, keep this in mind before using the file
